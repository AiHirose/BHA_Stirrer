Please add a 100 ohm resistor to the if the stirring thing gets thrown inside.   

#BHA Stirrer
This repo contains the designs and source files of a **DIY Magnetic Stirrer**. Such a device is used to stir liquids continiously for a long period of time. The optional heating pad keeps the liquid warm, it is not design for boiling or cooking.

The electronics of this device demonstrate parallel and serial wiring schemes. Instead of using 3 switches to set the power of the heating pad, you could also go for a potential meter.
